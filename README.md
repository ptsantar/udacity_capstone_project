## Udacity Cloud DevOps Nanodegree - Capstone Project
The goal of this repository is to test my skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program, such as:
 * Working in AWS
 * Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
 * Building pipelines
 * Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
 * Building Kubernetes clusters
 * Building Docker containers in pipelines

## Project scope
In this project, I am developing a CI/CD pipeline for micro services applications with blue/green deployment. A simple website will be used for starters with simple linting. Down the road a more advanced app may be added with more advanced steps, such as integration and performance testing or security scanning.
